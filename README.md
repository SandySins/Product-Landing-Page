# clipborad-landing-page
This is my start for creating project or 2nd start,I'm still a noob regarding using github.(this project is from https://www.frontendmentor.io it is really a good site for beginners in html and css)
Uptill now i haven't done any good projects after learning HTML and CSS ,its only watching courses video no practical,I hope that i can complete this 
project and learn something more in the process.

After doing this project I had come to know that I still have a long way to go.There still so much in html and css and here i thought i completed it, its going to be fun 
being able to use them.https://clipborad-landing-page.vercel.app/main.html .This is the link,I know its a noob work but i will be improving in time.
